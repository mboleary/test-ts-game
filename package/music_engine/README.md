# Music engine

The Music Engine is a strongly-timed dynamic music engine targeting the Web Audio API. The idea is to produce a library that is close to the Web Audio API spec, but implements additional functionality that doesn't have existing implementations.

## Features
- A sequencer
- Synthesizers for basic waveforms
- Midi playback
