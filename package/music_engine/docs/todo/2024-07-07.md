# TODO 2024-07-07

I added support for midi device output today and realized that some changes should be made to how midi messages are sent around.

- [ ] Explore implementing a class for each type of midi message
  - classes for NoteOn, NoteOff, Control
  - parent class has channel number, time offset, methods for serializing the bytes, etc.
  - main goal is to have serialization built in so that the messages are converted to bytes correctly
