# Game Component Implementation

Components are atoms of data that are attached to Entities. These are the building blocks of the Game Engine.

Examples include things like names, position in the world, health on an NPC, or even that an Entity is of a certain type.

This allows us to compose GameObjects by combining Components together and allowing the System to access and process these components
